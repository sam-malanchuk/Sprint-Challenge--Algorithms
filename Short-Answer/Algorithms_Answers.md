#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The while loop uses n * n * n which would mean we'd run it 3 to the 3rd power of n times but the while loop is resolved by 'a' which is set to 3 to the 2nd power which divides into the result causing your while loop only to be run exactly n amount of times. The result of which would be writen as the linear line O(n)

b) The for loop takes the range of n which would give us a runtime of n. The inner while loop runs off of a variable j being less than n but the while loop resovles by j being miltiplied by 2 which in all cases but a few will result in a faster resolution than n. That said first loop n and second log n would give use the linearithmic line of O(n log n)

c)
