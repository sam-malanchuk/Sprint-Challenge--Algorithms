a) The while loop uses n * n * n which would mean we'd run it 3 to the 3rd power of n times but the while loop is resolved by 'a' which is set to 3 to the 2nd power which divides into the result causing your while loop only to be run exactly n amount of times. The result of which would be writen as the linear O(n)

b)
