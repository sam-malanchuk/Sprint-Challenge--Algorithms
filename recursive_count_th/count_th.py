'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
    thCount = 0
    if word[0] + word[1] == "th":
        return wordL
    return word[0] + word[1]

print(count_th("Tenth"))

# Understand:
# takes in single string word
# checks how many times the string has the string 'th'
# cannot use any loops, must use recursion
